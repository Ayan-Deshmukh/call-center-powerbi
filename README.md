## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Business Intelligence assignment to help ServiceSpot, an IT company, gain visibility into its call center operations. With fragmented data spread across Excel and CSV files, the challenge was to build a centralized Power BI dashboard that reveals performance trends, cost drivers, wait time bottlenecks, and top-performing teams.
